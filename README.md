# IVESPA_GRL2023_scripts
MATLAB scripts for producing figures and tables from the IVESPA working group 2023 GRL paper. 

This repository contains the data and scripts required to reproduce the figures and tables of the IVESPA working group 2023 GRL paper titled "New insights into the relationship between mass eruption rate and volcanic column height based on the IVESPA dataset". Please cite our paper if you use any of these scripts. Most scripts use data from the IVESPA database (http://ivespa.co.uk/) to analyse the relationship between eruption source parameters such as the mass eruption rate, plume height, and atmospheric conditions. The repository contains the following:
-IVESPA_GRL2023_data.xlsx and TableS2.xlsx containing all data required to run the scripts
-a "function" subdirectory containing scripts of various functions called in the scripts used to produce figures
-a "figures_table_scripts" subdirectory containing scripts to produce figures and tables

Note that top-level comments are provided for the main figure and table scripts, and SI figure scripts are uncommented. Please contact t.aubry@exeter.ac.uk for additional help using the scripts.
